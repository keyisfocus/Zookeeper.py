## Stage 1
To begin with, you will develop a simple printer. Your program should display the text from the output example.

## Stage 2
For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.

## Stage 3
In this stage your program should:

1. Ask for the number of the desired habitat using the following phrase: `Please enter the number of the habitat you would like to view:`

2. Use the input number as an index of your habitats to print its content.

3. End with the following phrase:

---
You've reached the end of the program. To check another habitat, please restart the watcher.

## Stage 4
Your tasks at this point:

1. Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.

2. Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting `exit` should end the program.

3. When the program is done running, it should print: `See you later!`
